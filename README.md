# NLP Toolkit Task

This project is a simple **Natural Language Processing (NLP) demo toolkit** designed for educational purposes. It was used in class to demonstrate how different NLP techniques can be implemented using Python and popular libraries.

## What It Demonstrates

This toolkit includes examples of:

- **Sentiment Analysis** – Using TextBlob to evaluate tone and subjectivity
- **Text Classification** – Categorising text into classes using Naive Bayes
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** – Identifying names, places, dates, and organisations with spaCy
- **Machine Translation** – Translating text from French to English with Google Translate
- **Text Generation** – Generating text continuations using GPT-2 and the `transformers` library

## Who Is It For?

- Students learning about NLP concepts
- Instructors preparing class demos
- Beginners interested in exploring real-world applications of NLP

## How to Use

Each script can be run independently from the terminal or inside an IDE like PyCharm:

```bash
python sentiment_analysis.py
python text_classification.py
python named_entity_recognition.py
python translation.py
python text_generation.py
